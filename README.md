# HMItoNiryoNed
This repository can be used to connect a Weintek HMI to a Niryo NED robotic arm. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/31JwLmqIF9c.

You can open the projects by using the software "Easy Builder Pro" at the version 6.05.02.313 or higher.
If you have not yet downloaded this software you can do so at www.weintekusa.com/globalw/Software/EasyBuilderPro.aspx

If you intend to download my example projects to an HMI then you must use the one that correlates to your series of HMI.
For any cMT and cMTX series HMI's use the project "CMT Project.cmtp"
For any non-cMT series HMI use the project "NonCMT Project.emtp"
